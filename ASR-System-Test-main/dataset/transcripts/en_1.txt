Once there was a bird who fell in love with a whale.
And a whale who fell in love with a bird.
The bird loved the whale's beautiful smile.
He loved the way she swam through the water so gracefully.
The whale loved the bird's handsome white feathers.
She loved to watch him soar through the sky.
And they both loved to eat lots of tiny fish.
