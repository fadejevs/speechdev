Thank you, Mister Secretary General, your excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, and distinguished guests.
I'm honored to be here today, I stand before you not as an expert but as a concerned citizen,
one of the four hundred thousand people who marched in the streets of New York on Sunday, and the billions
of others around the world who want to solve our climate crisis.
As an actor I pretend for a living.
I play fictitious characters often solving fictitious problems.
I believe that mankind has looked at climate change in that same way, as if it were a fiction,
as if pretending that climate change wasn't real
would somehow make it go away.
