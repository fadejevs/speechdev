We have a federal government, which is based in Washington, D.C.,
and has jurisdiction over the entire country.
We have state governments, which of course there are fifty states in the US,
and then we have local governments, as well, municipal governments and
other things that also occur at a very kind of localized level.
The constitution in the United States is the most significant document there is.
It outlines the roles and responsibilities of the three branches of the federal government
and also determines to a large extent what laws can be passed.
