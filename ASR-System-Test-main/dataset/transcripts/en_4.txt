Stuck at an intersection,
you always watch unfold the Fundamental Problem of Traffic.
On green, the first car accelerates, and then the next,
and then the next, and then the next, and then you,
only to catch the red.
Had the cars accelerated simultaneously,
you would have made it through.
Coordination, not cars, is the problem,
because we are monkey drivers with slow reaction times
and short attention spans.
Even if we tried, getting everyone to press the pedal on three, two, one, now
would be challenging.
This discoordination limits how many cars can get through an intersection
and when one backs up to the next,
thats when city-sized gridlock cascades happen, taking forever to clear.
